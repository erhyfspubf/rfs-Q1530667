This is the hotdog web browser project. It's a web browser with its own layout and rendering engine, parsers, and UI toolkit!

It's made from scratch entirely in golang. External dependencies are only OpenGL and GLFW, even go dependencies are kept to a minimum.

The main goal of this project is to learn how web browsers work under the hood by implementing one. The browser is far from stable, spec-compliant, or even really useful, but, I'm slowly working on bringing more features and supporting more sites.
